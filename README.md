# Project1Team6

  Project Goal: To test common macro economic variables suitability in predicting Median Home Sale Prices. Various forms of testing were performed: time series and regression analysis.

  The team used the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) as the primary source of data. FRED is an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from scores of national, international, public, and private sources. The Labor of Burea Statistics(BLS.gov) was also used for CPI data.

The reason the topic was selected
To see the effect of housing prices over time

Description of the source of data
FRED is an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from scores of national, international, public, and private sources.

Questions the team hopes to answer with the data

Questions:
1. Does the Dow Jones Industrial Average have predictive ability or correlate with the Median Sales Price
2. Has Median Income increased in-line with Housing Prices
3. Impact of housing price on number of rental occupancies and cost thereof? (Rental Occupancy & Rent Price Index vs Median Sales Price of Home)
4. 
Does interest rate impact home price? ( 30 year fixed rate vs Median Sales Price of House)

Growth of income vs growth of house price? (Median sales price of houses sold vs Median household income)
Construction spending vs new residential? (total construction spending vs Median sales price for new houses Sold)
